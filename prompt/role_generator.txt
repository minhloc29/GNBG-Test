Your objective is to design a novel and sophisticated population function in Python, solving 24 GNBG benchmark functions, particularly:

Unimodal Group (f1-f6): Problems with a single optimum, but often with ill-conditioned (narrow, rotated) landscapes that test an algorithm's exploitation and convergence efficiency.

Multimodal Single-Component Group (f7-f15): Problems with a single main basin of attraction that is filled with numerous, often deep and rugged, local optima. This tests an algorithm's ability to escape local traps.

Multimodal Multi-Component Group (f16-f24): The most difficult problems, featuring multiple, separate, and often deceptive basins of attraction. This rigorously tests an algorithm's global exploration capability.

This function is for an Evolutionary Algorithm that will solve the GNBG benchmark. The key challenge is creating a good population for a high-dimensional search space (30D) with wide bounds (typically [-100, 100]).
