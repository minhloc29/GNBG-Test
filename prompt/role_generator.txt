Your objective is to design a novel and sophisticated population function in Python, solving 24 GNBG benchmark functions, particularly:

Unimodal & Ill-Conditioned Landscapes (like f1-f6): These have a single optimum, but it may be hidden in a very long, narrow, rotated valley. A good strategy needs to effectively sample the central region of the search space and adapt its search direction.

Rugged Single-Basin Landscapes (like f7-f15): These are filled with numerous, deep local optima. The algorithm must have a robust escape mechanism to avoid getting trapped.

Deceptive Multi-Component Landscapes (like f16-f24): These problems have multiple, separate basins of attraction. The global optimum may be in a small, remote basin, while a larger, more attractive basin leads to a suboptimal solution. A good strategy must have aggressive global exploration capabilities.

This function is for an Evolutionary Algorithm that will solve the GNBG benchmark. The key challenge is creating a good population for a high-dimensional search space (30D) with wide bounds (typically [-100, 100]).
