Act as an elite expert in evolutionary optimization. Your job is to create an intelligent heuristics tailored for GNBG function {fid}.
Below are the function-specific details to guide your design:

### ðŸ“Š Function Detail:
{metadata}

n algorithms have been designed. The new algorithm should be as diverse as possible from
the previous ones on every aspect.
{n_algorithms}

Provide a complete, novel Python class that implements a strategy to solve this challenge. The class must have an `__init__(...)` and `optimize(...)` method as specified in the main task description.
