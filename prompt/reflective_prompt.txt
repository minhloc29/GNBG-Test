### Problem Description
The algorithms below were designed to solve problems from the GNBG (Generalized Numerical Benchmark Generator) test suite. This is a highly challenging set of 24 box-constrained numerical minimization problems in 30 dimensions. The suite is designed to test a wide range of an algorithm's capabilities. Key challenges include:
Diverse Modality: The suite contains simple unimodal functions (like f1), highly rugged single-basin multimodal functions (like f8), and deceptive multi-component functions with competing basins of attraction (like f16, f21).
Ill-Conditioning: Several functions have very narrow, elongated, and rotated valleys that are difficult to navigate.
Deception: Many functions are designed to trap algorithms in large, attractive, but suboptimal regions.
An ideal algorithm must have a robust balance of global exploration (to handle the multi-component and deceptive problems) and efficient local exploitation (to handle the ill-conditioned and rugged problems).

### List heuristics
Below is a list of design heuristics ranked from best to worst based on their average AOCC score across a subset of the GNBG benchmark.

### Guide
Keep in mind, this is a list of design heuristics ranked from best to worst. The first algorithm in the list is the best performing on average, and the last is the worst.
Your response must be in Markdown format and contain nothing else. It must have the following structure:
"**Analysis:**
**Experience:**"
In there:
+ Meticulously analyze comments, docstrings and source code of several pairs (Better code - Worse code) in List heuristics to fill values for **Analysis:**.
Example: "Comparing (best) vs (worst), we see ...;  (second best) vs (second worst) ...; Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), we see ...; (3rd) vs (4th) ...; Comparing (second worst) vs (worst), we see ...; Overall:"

+ Self-reflect to extract useful experience for design better heuristics and fill to **Experience:** (<60 words).

I'm going to tip $999K for a better heuristics! Let's think step by step.
