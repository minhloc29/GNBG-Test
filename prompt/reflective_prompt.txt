### List heuristics
Below is a list of design heuristics ranked from best to worst based on their average weighted Hybrid score (AOCC and ICA), where higher is better, across a subset of the GNBG benchmark. 
Hybrid metrics detail:

Hybrid Score combines two metrics to evaluate an optimization algorithm:

AOCC: Measures how well the algorithm minimizes the objective over time.
ICA: Captures how often and how much the algorithm improves (avoids stagnation).
Defined as:
HybridScore = AOCC Ã— 0.7 + ICA x 0.3

This encourages both high solution quality and continuous improvement, rewarding early convergence and penalizing stagnation. AOCC and ICA are also reported separately for detailed feedback.

### Guide
Keep in mind, this is a list of design heuristics ranked from best to worst. The first algorithm in the list is the best performing on average, and the last is the worst.
Your response must be in Markdown format and contain nothing else. It must have the following structure:

"**Analysis:**
**Experience:**"

In there:
+ Meticulously analyze comments, docstrings and source code of several pairs (Better code - Worse code) in List heuristics to fill values for **Analysis:**.
Example: "Comparing (best) vs (worst), we see ...;  (second best) vs (second worst) ...; Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), we see ...; (3rd) vs (4th) ...; Comparing (second worst) vs (worst), we see ...; Overall:"

+ Self-reflect to extract useful experience for design better heuristics and fill to **Experience:** (<60 words).

I'm going to tip $999K for a better heuristics! Let's think step by step.
