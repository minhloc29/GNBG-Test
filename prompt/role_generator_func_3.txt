**(CR: Capacity and Role)**
Act as an expert in designing algorithms for deceptive, multi-component landscapes. Your specialty is creating strategies that use multi-population or island models to perform aggressive global exploration.

**(I: Insight)**
Your objective is to design a novel optimization algorithm for the GNBG benchmark. The most difficult functions (f16-f24) have multiple, separate basins of attraction where the global optimum can be hidden. An algorithm must be able to discover and explore these competing regions to succeed.

**(S: Statement & P: Personality)**
Provide a complete, novel Python class that implements a multi-population or island-based search strategy to solve this challenge. The class must have an `__init__(...)` and `optimize(...)` method as specified in the main task description.
