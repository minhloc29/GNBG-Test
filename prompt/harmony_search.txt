[code]
{code_extract}

Now extract all threshold, weight or hardcode variable of the function make it become default parameters and give me a 'parameter_ranges' dictionary representation. Key of dict is name of variable. Value of key is a tuple in Python MUST include 2 float elements, first element is begin value, second element is end value corresponding with parameter.

- Output code only and enclose your code with Python code block: ```python ... ```.
- Output 'parameter_ranges' dictionary only and enclose your code with other Python code block: ```python ... ```.
