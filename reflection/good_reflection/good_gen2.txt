Combining exploration strategies like DE or CMA-ES with targeted initialization and local search is crucial for high-dimensional multimodal optimization.  Adaptive parameter tuning improves robustness, but a well-chosen base algorithm is paramount for success.  Niching can help diversify the population, but it's not a substitute for strong exploration.
