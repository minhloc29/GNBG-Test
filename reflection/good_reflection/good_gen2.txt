Adaptive mutation strategies, informed by metrics like diversity or success rate, are crucial for handling diverse landscapes.  Efficient selection methods, such as tournament selection, prevent premature convergence.  Memory-based mechanisms, such as archives, significantly boost exploration capabilities in complex, high-dimensional problems.
