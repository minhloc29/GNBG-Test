Effective global optimization in deceptive landscapes requires a blend of memory, exploration, and adaptation. Archive-guided mutation enhances exploitation of past successes, while adaptive parameters dynamically tune the balance between exploration and exploitation. Island models offer diversity and parallelism to better search distinct basins of attraction. Implement some parameter auto-tuning to improve the result.
