Effective heuristics necessitate adaptive parameter control, diverse population initialization, and efficient archive management techniques which balance exploration and exploitation.  Sophisticated search mechanisms like LÃ©vy flights or adaptive DE, combined with novelty-based archive updates, prove crucial for high-dimensional multimodal optimization.
