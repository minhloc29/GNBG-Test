The analysis reveals that combining Differential Evolution with adaptive mutation (Cauchy in particular) and diversity maintenance strategies (clustering, archives, tournament selection) yields superior performance. Adaptive parameter control, particularly for mutation strength, is crucial for balancing exploration and exploitation.  Sophisticated selection mechanisms enhance performance further.
