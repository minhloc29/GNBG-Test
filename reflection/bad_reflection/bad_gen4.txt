Effective population generation for high-dimensional problems requires strategies that balance exploration (finding diverse solutions) and exploitation (refining promising areas).  Adaptive mechanisms, archives, and clustering prove crucial for handling complex, multimodal search spaces.  Careful selection methods and robust archive management significantly influence performance.
