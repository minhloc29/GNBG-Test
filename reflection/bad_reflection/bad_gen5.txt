Island-based algorithms with adaptive components and archives can effectively tackle multi-modal problems. Dynamic population sizing, guided mutation (archives), and migration strategies that responds to diversity (stagnation detection and or diversity thresholds.)  Also simple stochastic reset increases exploration.
