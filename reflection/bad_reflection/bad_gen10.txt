Effective population initialization and diversity maintenance are crucial.  Adaptive parameter control and a balance between exploration and exploitation, guided by novelty or other diversity metrics, are key to high performance on complex multimodal problems.  Simply combining algorithms isn't enough; sophisticated integration is essential.
