To design better heuristics, focus on incorporating adaptive mechanisms, leveraging archive-based techniques for diversity preservation and efficient selection strategies. Combining different mutation operators (e.g., Cauchy and Levy flights) can also improve exploration in complex high-dimensional spaces.  Careful parameter tuning is crucial for optimal performance.
