Effective population generation for high-dimensional multimodal problems needs diverse exploration and focused exploitation mechanisms.  Adaptive mutation, guided by an archive and coupled with strong optimization frameworks like DE, proves crucial.  Carefully selecting mutation distributions and incorporating robust selection strategies is key to success.
