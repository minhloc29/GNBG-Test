Adaptive mechanisms are crucial for handling high-dimensional, multimodal problems.  Combining different exploration strategies (like DE and LÃ©vy flights) with sophisticated selection and archive management significantly improves performance.  Careful parameter adaptation is essential for robustness and efficiency.
