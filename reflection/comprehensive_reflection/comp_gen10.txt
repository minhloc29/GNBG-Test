**Keywords:**  Heuristic design, multimodal optimization, exploration-exploitation, diversity, adaptation, parameter control, population initialization.

**Advice:** Focus on *novel* approaches to balancing exploration and exploitation. Investigate metrics beyond simple diversity measures (e.g., consider information-theoretic measures or landscape-aware metrics). Explore less-explored adaptive parameter control strategies (e.g., reinforcement learning for parameter tuning).  Develop rigorous theoretical analysis to guide heuristic design, moving beyond empirical evaluation alone.

**Avoid:**  Redundant phrases like "effective population generation," "adaptive parameter control," and "exploration-exploitation balance." Avoid simply listing known techniques without proposing novel combinations or modifications.  Avoid focusing solely on high-dimensional problems; consider the broader context of multimodal optimization.

**Explanation:** The provided ineffective self-reflections repeatedly mention the same concepts without offering genuinely new insights.  The redefined self-reflection should emphasize *innovative* ways to combine and improve existing techniques, rather than simply reiterating known best practices.  The focus should be on creating fundamentally new heuristics, not just incremental improvements.  Theoretical backing strengthens the design, leading to more robust and reliable heuristics.
