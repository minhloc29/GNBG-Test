Okay, I understand the goal. I need to provide guidance on how to approach designing better heuristics by reflecting on previous results, but I need to avoid the pitfalls of ineffective self-reflection.

Here's a breakdown:

*   **Keywords:** Deceptive landscapes, aggressive local search, strategic restarts, parameter adaptation (crossover rate), migration, algorithm comparison (AdaptiveIslandDE vs. AdaptiveIslandDifferentialEvolution).

*   **Advice:** Focus heuristic design on intensifying local search capabilities and restart strategies within optimization algorithms. Analyze and adapt migration frequency and strategy to promote diversity and reduce premature convergence, especially within deceptive regions.

*   **Avoid:** Solely adjusting parameter values without fundamentally improving search behavior, and generalization without rigorous testing.

*   **Explanation:** Heuristic improvement depends more on the ability of the algorithm to traverse deceptive areas of the search space. Aggressive local search, guided by good restart strategies, is key. While parameter tuning has some effect, the algorithm needs smart exploration.
