Okay, I understand. Here's a breakdown of how to refine "Current self-reflection" to design better heuristics for multi-component landscapes, steering clear of pitfalls.

**Redefined Self-Reflection:**

*   **Keywords:** Multi-component landscapes, heuristic design, balanced exploration/exploitation, information sharing, diversity management, adaptability, modularity.

*   **Advice:** Focus on creating modular heuristics that can adapt to different landscape characteristics. Decompose the problem to smaller self-contained parts, such as sub-population exploration, information sharing and adaptation. The most straightforward way to do it is with a configuration setting.

*   **Avoid:** Over-reliance on complex fixed architectures and intricate adaptation formulas. Minimal adjustments that aim to target overall adaptation characteristics such as average diversity, are undesirable, because one configuration of the algorithms would produce unpredictable result on different sub-populations.

*   **Explanation:** Modularize adaptation by allowing separate parts. This means designing independent configurable modules that would handle exploration, exploitation, population, and information sharing separately. The modules would automatically adapt to the sub-populations.
