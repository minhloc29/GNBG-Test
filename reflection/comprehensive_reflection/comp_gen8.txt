* **Keywords:**  Differential Evolution (DE), Adaptive Cauchy Mutation, Diversity Maintenance (Clustering, Archives, Tournament Selection), Adaptive Parameter Control.

* **Advice:** Focus on novel combinations of existing techniques. Investigate the interaction effects between adaptive mutation, selection, and diversity preservation methods. Explore less-studied aspects of existing methods (e.g., the specific parameters within Cauchy mutation,  novel clustering approaches). Develop rigorous experimental designs to quantify the individual contribution of each component.


* **Avoid:**  Generic statements about exploration/exploitation, high-dimensionality, or multimodal problems.  Repeating established knowledge about DE, Cauchy mutation, or archives. Overly broad claims about parameter tuning.


* **Explanation:** The ineffective reflections are redundant and lack specific, actionable insights. The redefined reflection focuses on identifying unexplored areas within the successful combination of DE, adaptive Cauchy mutation, and diversity maintenance.  The advice pushes for deeper investigation of component interactions and less-explored aspects of these components, thereby generating truly novel heuristics, justifying the investment.
