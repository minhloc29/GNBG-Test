**Keywords:** Adaptive heuristics, diversity preservation, efficient selection, mutation operator combination, parameter tuning.

**Advice:**  Focus on novel combinations of existing techniques rather than simply reiterating known best practices. Explore less common mutation operators and selection methods.  Develop rigorous methods for adaptive parameter tuning based on performance feedback, not intuition.  Emphasize measurable improvements in exploration and exploitation trade-offs.

**Avoid:**  Generic statements about exploration/exploitation, high-dimensionality, and multimodal problems.  Avoid unsubstantiated claims of superiority for specific operators (e.g., "Cauchy is best").  Refrain from simply listing known components of effective algorithms without proposing novel integrations.

**Explanation:** The provided "Ineffective self-reflection" examples suffer from vagueness and repetition.  To design better heuristics, we must move beyond generic advice and focus on concrete, testable improvements in specific algorithm components and their interactions.  Novelty and rigorous evaluation are key to justifying the claimed improvement.
