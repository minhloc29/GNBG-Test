Okay, I'll help you refine your self-reflection and translate that into better heuristic design principles, aiming to earn that generous tip! Here's a breakdown of effective versus ineffective approaches to guide the development of superior Differential Evolution (DE) heuristics, focused on avoiding pitfalls and highlighting key considerations:

*   **Keywords:** Adaptive DE, migration strategies, local search integration, fitness reassessment, exploitation-exploration balance, modular design, bound handling, landscape deception.

*   **Advice:** Prioritize a modular, adaptable framework for your DE algorithm. Focus on efficient fitness evaluation post-migration, ensuring local adaptation is rapidly applied to transplanted individuals. Balance DE's global search with intensive local exploitation. Pay special attention to bound handling and the impact of deceptive landscapes.

*   **Avoid:** Generic statements about needing restarts or parameter control. Avoid vague claims about "high performance" without specifics. Don't leave transplanted individuals without further optimization using local search and adaptive methods. Bypass batch calculation for quick efficacy is not preferred.

*   **Explanation:** Effective heuristics require a system where migration isn't just about moving individuals, but about triggering immediate re-evaluation and local adaptation. Modular code enables targeted adjustments. Focusing on balancing exploration and exploitation, *especially* in deceptive landscapes, is essential for success.
