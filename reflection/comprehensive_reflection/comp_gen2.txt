Okay, I'll help you redefine "Current self-reflection" to generate better heuristic design ideas for deceptive landscapes, keeping in mind the pitfalls described in "Ineffective self-reflection":

**Refined Self-Reflection for Deceptive Landscapes:**

*   **Keywords:** Adaptive exploration, population diversity, deception resistance, parameter adaptation, informed restarts, multi-trajectory optimization.
*   **Advice:** Emphasize maintaining population diversity while intensifying promising regions. Explore multi-trajectory optimization approaches, not just single-island models to avoid premature convergence. Adaptive parameter control should support, not replace, robust exploration.
*   **Avoid:** Over-reliance on aggressive local search *immediately* after migration (can lead to premature convergence to local optima). Treat local search as a crucial intensification *component* within a broader diversified strategy. Dismissing exploration in favor of exploitation.
*   **Explanation:** Deceptive landscapes require a balance. Initial local search can accelerate convergence. Maintaining diversity and using *informed* restart mechanism are the keys. Restarts shouldn't be random. A combination of approaches, guided by landscape analysis, are most reliable.

Now, use these points as cornerstones in the design of the improved heuristics for deceptive optimization landscape!
