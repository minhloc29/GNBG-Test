Okay, here's a reframing of "current self-reflection" focused on improved heuristic design for deceptive landscapes, incorporating your feedback and reward!

**Keywords:** Memory exploitation, exploration-exploitation balance, adaptive parameters, diversity maintenance, parallel search.

**Advice:** Design heuristics that intelligently remember promising regions, dynamically adjust exploration intensity, leverage island models for diversification, and incorporate mechanisms for parameter self-tuning.

**Avoid:** Overly complex adaptation mechanisms, focusing solely on normalized diversity.

**Explanation:** The goal is a flexible, self-adjusting search strategy that effectively exploits past successes while maintaining sufficient diversity to escape local optima in deceptive problem spaces.
